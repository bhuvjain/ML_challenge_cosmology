# ML challenge cosmology

This data challenge is designed to test and validate field level inference methods for weak lensing cosmology. These include deep learning methods such as CNNs and Bayesian Hierarchical Methods. The goal is to enable groups with varying levels of expertise in lensing and cosmology develop, test and validate their codes and to help the cosmology community evaluate their performance. The challenge will comprise a learning phase and a blind challenge phase.
